# 🦆 Duck Address Composer

Compose new emails from your DuckDuckGo `@duck.com` address using DuckDuckGo’s officially documented workaround.

---

## What this does

- Takes your DuckDuckGo `@duck.com` address
- Takes a recipient’s email address
- Generates the correctly formatted address to use when composing a new email

---

## How to use

1. Enter your DuckDuckGo `@duck.com` address  
2. Enter the recipient’s email address  
3. Click **Generate Address**  
4. Copy the result  
5. Use it as the **To** address in your email client

---

## Why this exists

DuckDuckGo Email Protection doesn’t currently allow sending new emails directly from a Duck address.

DuckDuckGo documents a supported workaround that requires formatting the recipient’s email in a specific way.  
This tool simply automates that formatting.
